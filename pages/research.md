**Environmental regulation risk and asset prices** <u><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=6135846#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Working Paper January 2026</a></u>  \

<p style="font-size: 0.9em; line-height: 1.5; color: #555; margin-top: 8px;"> We determine from market expectations how firms are affected by environmental regulatory risk. We use a text-based measure of environmental regulatory stringency derived from US EPA legal documents and industry-level relevance scores to capture time-varying regulatory risk exposure. We find that environmental regulatory stringency carries a positive and statistically significant risk premium, especially for firms with high cash holdings. For firms with low cash holdings, the effect is highly volatile, showing investors are uncertain about a firms future when faced with stricter regulation. Firms' environmental profiles further matter, as high-emission firms returns are negatively affected when regulatory stringency increases. Because regulatory text is released infrequently, challenging real-time risk analysis. We derive a high frequency, market-expectation capturing Environmental Regulatory Risk Index (ERRI). We show that ERRI captures shifts in investors' expectations of environmental regulatory risk and how it reacts during environmental policy and political developments</p>
